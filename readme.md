        Notes
            With the implementation of SRI, the CSS stylesheet will now only function on the live webpage. and attempt to veiw it offline will result in the Stylesheet not loading, due to the need to patch around CVE-2019-11730 as the CSS file being in the same directory can no longer satisfy CORS same Origin.
